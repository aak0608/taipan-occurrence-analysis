# 🐍 Coastal Taipan Sightings: An In-Depth Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This report explores the spatial and temporal patterns of **Coastal Taipan** (*Oxyuranus scutellatus*) sightings in Australia. By leveraging statistical methods and visualization techniques, we examine **when, where, and why** these highly venomous snakes are observed, and whether their geographical distribution has changed over time. 

#### taipan-occurrence-analysis

This repository contains a detailed report and exploratory data analysis of Taipan occurrences across various states of Australia. The analysis utilizes data sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA).

## 🔍 Key Research Questions

We address several intriguing questions regarding Coastal Taipan behavior and sightings:

1. **When are Coastal Taipans most frequently observed?**  
2. **Where in Australia are they most commonly sighted?**  
3. **Has their population increased over time?**  
4. **Are they limited to certain regions, or is their distribution shifting?**  
5. **How do weather conditions influence their sightings?**  

## 📊 Data & Methodology

- **Data Sources**: The dataset is primarily sourced from *Queensland Museum provider for OZCAM*, capturing sighting records across multiple years.
- **Statistical Approaches**:
  - Temporal and spatial analysis of sightings
  - Null hypothesis testing using permutation methods
  - Data visualization using R (e.g., ggplot2, null lineup plots)
- **Hypothesis Testing**: We investigate whether Coastal Taipan sightings are influenced by climate, habitat, and migration trends.

## 🔥 Key Insights

- **Seasonality**: Sightings are **higher between July and December**, aligning with the monsoon season and breeding cycles.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Coastal Taipans predominantly inhabit **Queensland’s coastal regions**, with some evidence of migration towards **Northern Territory**.
- **Population Trends**: An increase in reported sightings suggests **they are not endangered**, but sightings alone cannot confirm population growth.
- **Weather Influence**: Contrary to popular belief, **rainfall does not strongly correlate with sightings**, but warm temperatures **increase mobility and visibility**.
- **Regional Consistency**: Statistical analysis suggests **sightings remain largely consistent over time**, reinforcing their territorial nature.
